# Malware-Detection-Framework-for-a-virtual-environment
The main aim of the project is to generate alert signals (when a malign process is detected)using a static approach based on data visualization technique.

## What is Malign/Malicious Process?
Any process which tries to overexploit the available resources qualifies to be called as a malign or malicious process.
In the case of a virtual environment, CPU, memory, and network stream are the resources. So, the malign process will try to overexploit these resources by simply wasting the CPU cycles or by creating network traffic or by simply filling memory with unwanted data variables.

## How to Detect a Malign Process?
There two techniques which are majorly used for detection of the malign process:

1.Dynamic Analysis- Under this, each statement of the process is analyzed individually and observed the changes made in the resources after the successful execution of the statement. Thus a single process gets executed several times in order to classify as malign.

2.Data Visualization technique- Under this, binary images of the processes are created and then different Machine Learning techniques can be applied to the binary images in order to identify statements that qualify to be called malign.
